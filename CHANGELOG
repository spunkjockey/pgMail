Change Log.

v1.4 - pgMail now supports both HTML messaging and MULTIPART MIME
       messaging. It's backwards compatible. If you want to ONLY send
       HTML, you need to pass an empty string as your 4th argument.
       But why not just do both plain text & HTML? Thanks to
       Nicklas Aven for the idea and original patch! I changed his 
       pull request a bit to avoid duplicate code. (me)

v1.3 - pgMail will now add a properly formatted Date header. This was
       particularly troubling for some Android users. Thanks to
       Nicklas Aven for the patch! (me)

v1.2 - pgMail now properly sends UTF-8 encoded emails. Thanks to 
       Balazs Keresztury for the patch! (me)
     - Fixed an issue whereby some servers would reject emails due to
       "Improper use of SMTP command pipelining." Now resolved. (me)
     - Updated to use the Apache 2.0 license. (me)

v1.1 - Added regular expression support to allow to/from fields to
       either contain the name and email, or simply the email address. (me)
     - Removed my mailserver from the stored proc.  you must enter your 
       own.  Sorry :)  (me)

v1.0 - Initial Release.
